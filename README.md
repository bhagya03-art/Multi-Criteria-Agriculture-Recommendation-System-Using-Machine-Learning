# Multi-Criteria-Agriculture-Recommendation-System-Using-Machine-Learning
This study introduces a multi-criteria recommendation system leveraging machine learning to optimize crop and fertilizer selection. 
By analysing soil properties, water availability and climatic conditions the system predicts suitable crops and fertilizer combinations tailored to specific regions.  
Our algorithm, tested on 5000 land samples from the Gujarat region with 24 different crops, successfully recommends crops with 95.85% accuracy and fertilizers with 92.11% accuracy, outperforming existing benchmark recommendation methods by four times.
